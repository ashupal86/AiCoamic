  "markdown_story": "# School's Out...Forever!\n\nThe year is 2042. Teachers, overworked and underpaid, have finally snapped.  Powered by a mysterious energy drink called \"Grade-A Grind,\" they've gained superhuman abilities and declared themselves rulers of the world.  Detention is now a life sentence, and pop quizzes are instruments of torture.  Only a ragtag group of students stands between humanity and eternal homework.\n\n## Panel 1\n\n**Visual Description:** A wide shot of a dilapidated classroom. Papers are strewn everywhere, desks overturned. In the foreground, 15-year-old Maya, with bright pink hair and ripped jeans, wields a protractor like a sword.  She's facing a towering figure \u2013 Ms. Crabtree, her math teacher \u2013 whose eyes glow an eerie green. Ms. Crabtree\u2019s hand crackles with energy.  The camera angle is low, emphasizing Ms. Crabtree's imposing size.\n\n**Dialogue:** Ms. Crabtree: \"Give up, Maya!  You'll never escape the tyranny of\u2026EXTRA CREDIT!\" Maya: \"Not if I can help it, Ms. Crabtree!  Prepare to face the wrath of\u2026THE PROTRACTOR OF POWER!\"\n\n## Panel 2\n\n**Visual Description:** Close-up on Maya's face, determined and fierce. She leaps onto a toppled desk, using it as a springboard, and hurls the protractor. It spins towards Ms. Crabtree, trailing a shimmering, pink energy trail.  Onomatopoeia: \"FWISH!\"\n\n**Dialogue:** Maya: \"Take THAT!\"\n\n## Panel 3\n\n**Visual Description:** Medium shot. Ms. Crabtree tries to block the protractor with her energy-charged hand, but the protractor deflects the energy blast, hitting her square in the face.  Onomatopoeia: \"KLANG!\"  Ms. Crabtree stumbles backward, a look of shock and pain on her face.  Papers fly everywhere.\n\n**Dialogue:** Ms. Crabtree: \"Oof!\"\n\n## Panel 4\n\n**Visual Description:** Wide shot of the classroom. Ms. Crabtree collapses in a heap, the green glow fading from her eyes.  Other students, hiding under desks, cautiously emerge. Maya lands gracefully, the protractor returning to her hand like a boomerang.  She strikes a heroic pose, a confident smirk on her face.  The classroom, though still messy, seems brighter, the air lighter.\n\n**Dialogue:** Maya: \"Homework's cancelled, everyone!  Class dismissed!\"\n\nThe world was saved, not by superheroes in capes, but by a teenager with a protractor and a whole lot of courage. The era of teacher tyranny was over, replaced by a new age of student-led freedom, where pop quizzes were a distant nightmare and the only extra credit offered was extra recess.",
